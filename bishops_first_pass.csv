"Arthur was born in Aldershot, Hampshire, England and educated at Dover College.  He received a Master of Arts from the University of St Andrews (1885) and a MB ChB from the University of Edinburgh (1888).  He worked in the slums of Edinburgh, but contracted typhoid fever.  He met and married his wife in Australia in 1890.  He returned to Europe and studied hypnotism in Paris, which earned him an MD from the University of Edinburgh in 1891.[1]  After again becoming ill working in the slums of London, he returned to Australia and established a practice in the Sydney suburb of Mosman, specialising in eye, ear-nose-and-throat, and dental work.  He was a director of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital from 1917 to 1920 and from 1927 to 1931 and of Sydney Hospital from 1924 to 1932.[2]Arthur was elected in 1904 to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as member for Middle Harbour, representing the Liberal and Reform Party.  In December 1912, he became the inaugural president of the Eugenics Society of New South Wales.[3] He became an early advocate of child endowment in 1916 and was a strong supporter of closer settlement and assisted immigration to reduce the Japanese threat.  From 1920 to 1927, he represented North Shore.  He was chairman of the 1923 Royal Commission on Lunacy Law and Administration and, as a eugenicist, recommended special training and institutions for ""defectives"".   He represented Mosman from 1927 to 1932 and was Minister for Public Health from 1927 to 1930 during the Bavin Government,[4]  but he failed to carry a mental defectives bill.[2]Arthur died in Mosman and was  survived by his wife, son and two daughters.[2]",Romania,Limerick,1620.0,Richard Arthur,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dlimr.html,1646.0

"George Brann (23 April 1865 – 14 June 1954) was an English amateur cricketer and footballer who had a long career with Sussex County Cricket Club at the end of the 19th century, and played three matches for the England national football team.Brann was born in Eastbourne, East Sussex and was educated at Ardingly College, near Haywards Heath, West Sussex, where he spent ten years and represented the school at football.[1]After leaving school he joined the Swifts based in Slough, who in 1890 merged with Slough Albion and Young Men's Friendly Society to form a new club, Slough F.C., who later became Slough Town.Being an amateur, Brann was free to play for more than one club, and he joined the famous amateur club Corinthian in 1885. He made his first appearance for them in a 3–1 defeat against Preston North End on 28 November 1885. In the 1885–86 season he played eight times for Corinthian, in all five forward positions, scoring three goals.[2]",Romania,Dromore,1483.0,George Brann,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/ddrom.html,1499.0

"Inge was born at Shepton Mallet in Somerset. Not much seems to be known about his parents, except that they  destined him for a career in the Church from an early age.[3] He was educated at Winchester College and became a fellow of New College, Oxford in 1484 and a Doctor of Divinity in 1511. He held a number of minor benefices in England including the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Westonzoyland from 1508.[4] After travelling for a time around Europe, he became attached to the household of Adriano Castellesi, the Italian-born Bishop of Bath and Wells, and went with him to Rome in 1504. In about 1511 he came to the notice of Cardinal Wolsey, who recognised his gifts and advanced his career: he later admitted that he owed everything he achieved to Wolsey,  and  that ""without him I had no comfort in this world"".[5]In 1512, through Wolsey's influence, he was made Bishop of Meath. There  seems to have been a  later quarrel between the two men,  leading to a brief estrangement, since in 1514 Inge wrote to Wolsey imploring him not to ""cast him away"".[6] The quarrel was short-lived, and Inge followed the same career path as William Rokeby, whom he succeeded both as Archbishop of Dublin and Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1521. He was a popular and respected figure in Ireland, and enjoyed the friendship of Gerald FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare, the dominant statesman in Irish politics for many years.[7]Inge carried out extensive repairs to the episcopal palace of St. Sepulchre; his name is commemorated in Hugh Inge's door, which was restored in the eighteenth century;[8] a few fragments of the door were discovered during excavations some years ago, at present-day Kevin Street.  The door was described as having an unusual three-centred head.[9]The Archbishop was vigilant in protecting the rights and privileges of the See of Dublin, and in 1524 he complained to the Privy Council of Ireland that the city fathers of Dublin, headed by Nicholas Queytrot (or Coitrotte), who had lately held office as Lord Mayor of Dublin, had unlawfully occupied the Manor of St. Sepluchre (St. Sepulchre actually consisted of several adjoining manors, which covered most of present day Dublin city south of the River Liffey).  According to Inge, the manor was a ""liberty"" under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop (Queytrot was a prominent Dublin merchant and builder, who later served as the city auditor). The Council referred the matter to the three Chief Justices of the Courts of Common Law, who ruled that the disputed lands were indeed within the liberty of the Archbishop,  and that he and his successors were entitled to hold  it in perpetuity  without  let or hindrance by the Mayor of Dublin.[10] At the same time he was engaged in a lawsuit with the Dean and Chapter of the Diocese of Kildare as to his rights of Visitation in the Diocese if the office of Bishop of Kildare happened to be vacant: the outcome of this lawsuit is unknown[11]",Romania,Dublin,1523.0,Hugh Inge,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/ddubl.html,1528.0

"In May 1533 he expressed approval of Henry VIII's marriage with Anne Boleyn in a sermon preached before the King. In 1541 he became dean of Hereford, and in 1555 Queen Mary nominated him to the Archbishopric of Dublin, and in the same year he was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland. He acted as  Lord Justice of Ireland  during the absence from Ireland of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, the Earl of Sussex, in 1557.On the accession of Elizabeth, Curwen at once accommodated himself to the new conditions by declaring himself a Protestant, and was continued in the office of Lord Chancellor. He was accused by the Archbishop of Armagh of serious moral delinquency, and his recall was demanded both by the Primate and Hugh Brady,   Bishop of Meath. In 1567 Curwen resigned the see of Dublin and the office of Lord Chancellor, and was appointed Bishop of Oxford, but died the following year.",Romania,Dublin,1555.0,Hugh Curwen,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/ddubl.html,1559.0

"Born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, Gaffney's family moved to Worcester when he was 11. He began playing baseball as a third baseman, but his promising career was ended when he injured his arm throwing a snowball in 1880, reportedly just before being promoted to the National League. He became a printer, and started umpiring college games involving nearby Ivy League teams in 1883.He joined the National League's umpiring staff in August 1884, with his first game being an 11-inning, 1-0 game between the two teams battling for first place, Providence and Boston. He quickly gained wide respect as a top officiator, and as the league's best judge of balls and strikes. In the middle of his third season, his knowledge of the game was so highly regarded that he was offered the managing position of the Washington Nationals, and he took over the team on August 21, 1886. The team, mired in last place, finished the last third of the season without improving its position; but Gaffney continued in the post for the entire 1887 campaign, with a slight improvement to 7th place. He finished his managing career with 61 wins against 101 losses. He was much-liked by the players, and while he was traveling during the 1887 world championship series, his players – including catcher Connie Mack and future umpiring great Hank O'Day – boarded his train during a Washington stopover and surprised him with the gift of a diamond ring in appreciation of his efforts.Into the 1880s, baseball had always been played with the use of a single umpire, but by late in the decade it was becoming apparent that this was an unsatisfactory arrangement for the most important games. The 1886 World's Championship Series had witnessed a two-game experiment in which each team selected an umpire – both positioned behind the catcher – with a third official, called a referee, positioned behind the pitcher and able to move about the bases. However, the referee was only permitted to make calls when the two umpires either disagreed or requested his decision; this system was deemed a failure by all observers. The following year, Gaffney was selected by the NL as one of the two umpires to work the 1887 series, along with Kick Kelly, who was regarded as the best umpire in the American Association from 1883-86 before managing that league's Louisville team in 1887. The two worked out a system whereby one umpire would work behind home plate, calling balls and strikes, while the other positioned himself in the field to make calls on the bases. This format was a decided success, and although it was not until almost 1910 that two umpires per game became standard, it formed the basis for the multiple umpire systems which followed. Gaffney later umpired in the 1888 and 1889 championship series, and again for three games in the 1892 NL championship series, for a total of 37 postseason games – a 19th-century record.After the 1887 series, Gaffney and Kelly both returned to umpiring, although they switched leagues in the process – Kelly moved to the NL for the 1888 season, while Gaffney switched to the American Association for 1888-89, where he received a salary of $2,500 plus road expenses, making him easily the best-paid umpire. In the American Association, Gaffney pioneered the practice of moving from behind the catcher to behind the pitcher when a batter reached first base, a crucial move in the days of solitary umpires. He made other innovations, including calling balls fair or foul depending on where they cleared the fence rather than where they landed, and creating a shirt in which extra baseballs could be stored. After each season, he reported omissions and inadequacies in the rules to the league, and many of his suggested revisions were enacted.",Romania,Ardagh (and Clonmacnois),1622.0,John Gaffney,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/darda.html,

"He was the author of two books which were an important influence on the development of scholastic logic: Introductiones in Logicam (Introduction to Logic), and Syncategoremata. These are the first known works to deal in a systematic way with what is now called supposition theory, known in William's time as the logica moderna.William was probably born in Nottinghamshire, between 1200 and 1210. In common with many educated English men of that time, he may have studied at Oxford university or the University of Paris, or both. There are examples in his logical work which suggest he was a master at Paris. (For example, No man lectures at Paris unless he is a smart person and Whatever runs has feet, the Seine runs, ergo the Seine has feet).  Further evidence that he lectured in Paris is that those logicians who were influenced by his work also worked there, including Peter of Spain (c. 1245) and Lambert of Auxerre (c. 1250).He is thought to have become treasurer of Lincoln Cathedral some time in the 1250s. The treasurer was one of the four principal officers of the English cathedrals whose duty was to keep the treasures of the church – the gold and silver vessels, ornaments, relics, jewels, and altar cloths. He would have had a personal residence in the Cathedral close, would have employed a deputy and a large staff, and therefore could be absent as long as he performed those duties that could not be delegated.[1] He probably died there in or before 1272.[2]He is mentioned by Roger Bacon, who had also been a Master at Paris, as among ""the more famous wise men of Christendom"" one of whom named is Albertus Magnus, another of whom is master William of Sherwood, ""the treasurer of the church of Lincoln in England, who is much wiser than Albert"".[3]",Romania,Meath,1460.0,William Sherwood,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dmeat.html,1482.0

"Born probably about 1490, he is said to have been a native of Lincolnshire or Lancashire. He was educated first at Oxford and then at Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1511, and M.A. in 1514.[1] In 1525 he was made canon of Cardinal College, Oxford, and on 9 March 1526 he supplicated for incorporation in Oxford University, and for the degrees B.D. and D.D. About the same time he was appointed chaplain to Henry VIII. On 7 March 1528 he was presented to the prebend of Wigginton in the collegiate church of Tamworth, but resigned it in the following July, and was appointed master of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London. He resigned the latter post in July 1532 on being instituted to the vicarage of Thaxted, Essex.Meanwhile, in 1530, at Henry's request, Pope Clement VII provided Staples to the bishopric of Meath. In that capacity he took a prominent part in the government of Ireland, and in the strife between the various factions of the official class. In 1534 he was compelled to flee to England before the rebellion of Thomas Fitzgerald, 10th Earl of Kildare. He returned in the following year, when he and Archbishop George Browne became Henry VIII's principal instruments in introducing the Protestant Reformation into Ireland. His relations with Browne, however, were always hostile. Staples clung to the mass, though he was strongly for the Royal Supremacy, and it was partly owing to his advice that Henry assumed the title of King of Ireland. His quarrel with Browne became such a scandal that on 31 July 1537 Henry wrote to Browne threatening to remove him for his lightness of behaviour and pride, and to Staples censuring his neglect of his ecclesiastical duties.  Little effect seems to have been produced, and on one occasion in 1538, while preaching before Browne in Kilmainham church, Staples denounced him as a heretic. This sermon was examined by the Privy Council of Ireland, and both Staples and Browne complained to Thomas Cromwell, but the quarrel was patched up. In 1544, as a reward for his zeal, Staples was allowed to annex the archdeaconry of Kells though he lost the same benefice by 1547.After Edward VI's accession, Staples's Protestant opinions became more pronounced, On 7 April 1547 he was granted the parsonage of Ardbraccan, and soon after was made judge of faculties. About this time he married, and preached a strong sermon against the mass, which rendered him intensely unpopular in his diocese. In June 1552, in a discussion at St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin, he maintained the Protestant cause against George Dowdall, archbishop of Armagh.In August 1553 he took part in the proclamation of Queen Mary, but on 29 June 1554 he was deprived on account of his marriage. He remained in his diocese, destitute and disliked, and on 16 December 1558, after Elizabeth's accession, he wrote to William Cecil relating his woes and seeking preferment. He was not, however, restored to his see, and, as no subsequent mention of him occurs, he is believed to have died soon after.",Romania,Meath,1529.0,Edward Staples,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dmeat.html,1554.0

"Born in Ireland, 1568; died at Galway, 1651. He sprang from an ancient Irish family at one time possessing considerable landed property in County Cavan and County Westmeath. In youth he acquired some proficiency in the Irish language, in which language he wrote some poems. Having determined to become a priest, he proceeded to Paris, where after ordination he spent the first years of his priesthood. During this time he became rector of the Irish College in Paris. Dease returned to Ireland in 1621, having been appointed Bishop of Meath. Thomas Messingham succeeded him as rector.[1]He was consecrated the following year. In spite of persecution and penal laws he continued loyal to England and preached loyalty to his flock. He regarded with disfavour the Confederation of Kilkenny, and resisted all the arguments and entreaties of the primate to join it. This conduct brought him toleration, if not favour, from the Government, though it made him unpopular with his Catholic fellow-countrymen. And it specially annoyed the nuncio, Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, who charged him with having sown the seeds of enmity between the Confederate generals Thomas Preston and Owen Roe O'Neill. The news of Dease's death was therefore received, in 1648, by the nuncio with little regret. But the news turned out false, and the nuncio writing to Rome reported that the bishop still lived ""to try the patience of the good"".[2]",Romania,Meath,1621.0,Thomas Dease,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dmeat.html,1652.0

"The character has a well-documented feud with Detective Hank Voight (Jason Beghe), a protagonist on Chicago Fire spin-off Chicago P.D..[2][3] The introduction of Voight and other Chicago PD characters eventually led to the creation of the namesake spin-off, in which Voight's full story is further clarified in the first season. Although Voight is shown to be highly dedicated cop and earns the grudging respect of Casey's co-workers, his presence is still met with tension and suspicion from the firefighters of 51 as a result of what happened between him and Casey. Casey's storyline crosses with Voight once again in the season 3 finale of Chicago Fire, as he goes missing after agreeing to help Voight gather information on a client he was doing renovation works for.[4]As the leader of the truck company, Casey's cool and standoffish demeanor and no-nonsense attitude sometimes puts his crew off but he is respected by them and highly regarded by Chief Boden. He is extremely private about his personal life, preferring to wallow in his own problems rather than seek help from his colleagues, and sometimes comes across as distant and aloof as he usually keeps to himself during down time even when around them in the lounge room. In the season 4 premiere, Herrmann tellingly comments that the way Casey deals with things is ""not dealing with it""; of all the characters, he generally confides to Severide or Dawson and only after he is at his breaking point. Despite this, Casey does care for his men and will not hesitate to defend them, even if it means standing up to his superiors and risking his own career.[5] He trusts the men of his truck company implicitly (and vice versa) and is generally quite lax with them in good faith that they will maintain professional standards themselves,[6][7] only disciplining them when he has no choice. However, he is known for being tough with candidates, as seen with Mills, Jones and now Borrelli and would either personally or have one of his more senior firefighters regularly drill them.Casey is the son and second child of both his mom and dad and is also the younger brother of his older sister Christie. He is also burdened by his ex-convict mother Nancy, who shattered the family 15 years earlier after murdering his abusive father. He has an older sister, Christie, who he grew distant from over their father's death, but they have since mended their relationship. His family still remains a touchy subject and, according to veterans Mouch and Herrmann, there is an unspoken rule within the firehouse that no one is to mention Casey's family or ask him about them.[6] His relationship with Gabriela Dawson is a major storyline throughout the series and they eventually marry in the series' 100th epsisode.A skilled handyman and carpenter, Casey freelances as a construction contractor when off-duty. Other characters have consulted him for advice on construction-related issues. For example, he was ""consulted"" by Herrmann on renovation works and building code compliance for Molly's and built a ramp for a paraplegic accident victim he and his men had rescued.",Romania,Clogher,1287.0,Matthew Casey,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dclog.html,1316.0

"Patrick Duffy (born March 17, 1949)[1] is an American actor, best known for his role on the CBS primetime soap opera Dallas, where he played Bobby Ewing, the youngest son of Miss Ellie and the nicest brother of J.R. Ewing (played by Barbara Bel Geddes and Larry Hagman respectively) from 1978 to 1985 and from 1986 to 1991. Duffy returned to reprise his role as Bobby in a continuation of Dallas, which aired on TNT from 2012 to 2014. He is also well known for his role on the ABC sitcom Step by Step as Frank Lambert, from 1991 to 1998, and for his role as Stephen Logan on the CBS daytime soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful (2006-2011). Duffy played the lead character's father in the 2014 NBC sitcom Welcome to Sweden.Duffy was born in Townsend, Montana, in 1949, the son of tavern owners Marie and Terence Duffy.[1][2] During high school, Duffy was living in Everett, Washington, and attended Cascade High School. At Cascade, he participated in the Drama Club and the Pep Club, for which he was a Yell King.[2][3] Academically, Duffy earned credentials in theater arts that entitled him to teach, graduating from the University of Washington in 1971 with a degree in drama.[4]  He ruptured both his vocal cords during his senior year of college, so he created the position of actor-in-residence, where he worked as an interpreter for ballet, opera, and orchestra companies in Washington. He also taught mime and movement classes during this period.[5]In 1977, Duffy landed the role of Mark Harris in the short-lived television series Man from Atlantis. Following the series' cancellation in early 1978, he got his big break in the role of Bobby Ewing, opposite Barbara Bel Geddes and Larry Hagman, on the soap opera Dallas.[4] The show became a worldwide success. Despite its success, Duffy opted to leave the series in 1985 with his character being killed off onscreen. However, with both the show and his career on the decline, he returned in 1986 in the infamous shower scene that rendered the entire 1985–1986 season ""just a dream."" Duffy then remained with the series until its cancellation in 1991. He also appeared in several episodes of the spin-off series Knots Landing between 1979–82. Throughout the 13-year run of Dallas, Duffy directed several episodes of the series. Along with Dallas fame, Duffy has also tried his hand at singing, and in 1983, he had a hit in Europe with ""Together We're Strong"", a duet with French female singer Mireille Mathieu.[4] The single reached #5 in the Netherlands in April 1983.[6]At the end of Dallas' run in 1991, Duffy began another television role, as Frank Lambert on the family sitcom, Step by Step in which he co-starred with Suzanne Somers. The series ran until 1998, and Duffy also directed numerous episodes. Also in the 1990s, he appeared in two Dallas reunion television movies; J.R. Returns (1996) and War of the Ewings (1998), both of which he also co-produced. He has reunited on several occasions with many of his Dallas co-stars both onscreen and off, most notably for the non-fiction television special Dallas Reunion: Return to Southfork in 2004. Duffy later continued to act in the occasional guest or voice acting appearance, including the series Family Guy (in which he appeared in a live action scene with Victoria Principal as they spoofed the Dallas shower scene), as well as Justice League and Touched by an Angel. Duffy starred in the television movies Falling in Love With the Girl Next Door and Desolation Canyon.  In 2006, he began a recurring role on the daytime soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful as Stephen Logan. From April to July 2008, he hosted Bingo America, a partially interactive game show on GSN.",Romania,Clogher,1671.0,Patrick Duffy,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dclog.html,1675.0

"George Brann (23 April 1865 – 14 June 1954) was an English amateur cricketer and footballer who had a long career with Sussex County Cricket Club at the end of the 19th century, and played three matches for the England national football team.Brann was born in Eastbourne, East Sussex and was educated at Ardingly College, near Haywards Heath, West Sussex, where he spent ten years and represented the school at football.[1]After leaving school he joined the Swifts based in Slough, who in 1890 merged with Slough Albion and Young Men's Friendly Society to form a new club, Slough F.C., who later became Slough Town.Being an amateur, Brann was free to play for more than one club, and he joined the famous amateur club Corinthian in 1885. He made his first appearance for them in a 3–1 defeat against Preston North End on 28 November 1885. In the 1885–86 season he played eight times for Corinthian, in all five forward positions, scoring three goals.[2]",Romania,Elphin,1499.0,George Brann,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/delph.html,1504.0

"He was born at Villacastín.[1] He joined the Society of Jesus in 1570, and taught at the University of Salamanca. He acted as confessor to Teresa of Avila. He died in 1591 at the age of fifty-four, one year after the publication of his work In Sacrum Beati Ioannis Apostoli, & Evangelistiae Apocalypsin Commentarij.[2]In the late Middle Ages and in the wake of the Protestant Reformation, accusations of being the Antichrist were levied against the Pope. Amidst the controversy, Ribera  in 1585 began writing a lengthy (500 page) commentary on the Book of Revelation, titled In Sacrum Beati Ioannis Apostoli, & Evangelistiae Apocalypsin Commentarii, proposing that the first chapters of the Apocalypse applied to ancient pagan Rome, and the rest referred to a yet future period of 3½ literal years, immediately prior to the second coming. During that time, the Roman Catholic Church would have fallen away from the pope into apostasy. Then, he proposed, the Antichrist, a single individual, would:To accomplish this, Ribera understood the 1260 days and 42 months and 3½ times of prophecy literally, rejecting an interpretation as 1260 years.Futurism (Christianity) is the proposal that the Book of Revelation does not bear the application to the Middle Ages or the papacy, rather the ""future"" (more particularly to a period immediately prior to the Second Coming). The Dictionary of Premillennial Theology (1997)  states that Ribera was an Augustinian amillennialist, whose form of futurism  proposed that only the introductory chapters of ""Revelation referred to ancient Rome, and the remainder referred to a literal three and half years at the end of time.

"He was born in County Meath, son of John Netterville of Dowth and Alison St Lawrence, daughter of Nicholas St Lawrence, 4th Baron Howth.[1] His family had a long association with the law: the first recorded member of the family in Ireland was Nicholas de Netterville, who was appointed  a judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) in 1301. John's cousin and brother-in-law Thomas Netterville was a judge of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland), and after John's death his widow remarried  yet another  High Court judge, Sir Patrick White.[2]In 1555 Netterville  in his capacity as owner of Dowth was involved in litigation with another High Court judge,  Walter Kerdiff.  In 1558 he served on a commission to inquire into the lands held by  Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare. The following year he was appointed second justice of the Court of King's Bench. In 1560 he sat on a commission to inquire into martial law in Meath, but died later the same year.[3]Some years after his death the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Henry Sidney,  described Luke in disparaging terms as   a man who was ""but second justice of one of the Benches...... of mean family.......born to nothing."" [4]"" This  attack  was in the course of an attempt to damage the career of Luke's son Richard,  who was one of Sidney's bitterest enemies, and there is no reason to think that  his low opinion of Luke was widely shared.Luke married Margaret Luttrell, daughter of Sir Thomas Luttrell,  Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas,  and had two sons:",Romania,Armagh,1220.0,Luke Netterville,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/darma.html,1227.0

"FitzRalph was born into a well-off burgess family of Anglo-Norman/Hiberno-Norman descent in Dundalk, Ireland. He is noted as an ex-fellow and teacher of Balliol College, at the University of Oxford in 1325 (which is the earliest known record of him).[citation needed] By 1331, he was a Regent master in Theology, and soon after was made Vice-Chancellor of the University; this was an almost unparalleled achievement for someone still in his early thirties, let alone an Irishman (although Prince, in his ""Worthies of Devon"" makes the case for him being a Devonian).[1]As Vice-Chancellor, FitzRalph was faced with the crisis caused by the famous secession of masters and students to Stamford in Lincolnshire, and it is thought that this issue may have caused his first visit to the Papal Court at Avignon in 1334. He returned to England the following year having been appointed Dean of Lichfield — ""notwithstanding that he has canonries and prebends of Crediton and Bosham, and has had provision made for him of the Chancellorship of Lincoln and the canonries and prebends of Armagh and Exeter, all of which he is to resign."" In 1337 he was again compelled to visit Avignon, where he remained till 1344. On 31 July 1346, he was consecrated Archbishop of Armagh. In both of these positions, he was revered as thoughtful and competent administrator.From 1344, FitzRalph began to keep an account in diary form of his sermons. The shorter, less consequential ones were summarised, while the longer, more learned theological sermons were written in full. This was especially true for those he preached at Avignon. Both forms were written in Latin, and show his love of learning, shared by friends such as Richard of Bury. He is also believed to have sent many of his priests to study at Oxford to further their learning. His writings include his thoughts on infinity, predestination and free will. Like his fellow Irishmen Henry Crumpe and Dr. John Whitehead he was involved in controversy with the Franciscan friars.The texts demonstrate that FitzRalph was pre-occupied with social problems in Ireland – twenty-nine sermons were given in Dundalk, Drogheda, Dublin and various places in Meath to churchmen (whom he criticised for their laxity of vocation), merchants (whom he attacked for wasteful extravagances and underhanded trading practises) and the general population, among whom he was very popular as a preacher. At a time of often hostile racial relations between the colonists and natives, he took an honourable stand in denouncing discrimination against the Gaelic Irish. At times severe, this was balanced by his very fair and serious approach as pastor of his flock, be they English, Anglo-Irish, or Gaelic.",Romania,Armagh,1346.0,Richard FitzRalph,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/darma.html,1360.0

"He was English by birth, a descendant of the Cromer (also spelt Crowemer) family of Tunstall, Kent and Cromer, Norfolk. Caught up in Henry's Reformation  of the Church of England, he was deprived of his see of  Armagh.[2] He  continued in place as Archbishop of Armagh,  despite suspicions from Henry about his true beliefs  and   despite being suspended  by the Pope on a charge of  heresy.[3][4]He was Lord Chancellor of Ireland  1532-4, as a placeman of Garrett, 9th Earl of Kildare, whose family dominated Irish politics   from the 1470s until  the late 1530s.[5][6]",Romania,Armagh,1521.0,George Cromer,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/darma.html,1539.0

"He was born in Drogheda, the  son of Edward Dowdall.[1] The Dowdall family came to Ireland from Dovedale in Derbyshire in the thirteenth century and settled in County Louth. Several  members of the family became distinguished lawyers and judges. George had at least one brother, Christopher, who married  Thomasine Cusack,  a member of the prominent  Cusack family of Cussington,  County Meath, and was the father of James Dowdall, who  became Lord Chief Justice of Ireland.George entered the Order of the Brethren of the Cross (colloquially known as the Crutched Friars) at an early age and became the last Prior of their house at Ardee.[2]He was appointed Primate of All Ireland by Henry VIII in 1543 to succeed George Cromer.[3] However, his   appointment  was not recognised by the Pope, who had earlier replaced Cromer with Robert Wauchope. Dowdall accepted Henry's position as Supreme Head on Earth of the Church of Ireland, but like Henry he took an anti-Protestant  theological position. This  position became unsustainable in the reign of Edward VI. Dowdall would not accept the new liturgy,  and in 1552 he withdrew to a monastery in Brabant, and was replaced by Hugh Goodacre. By this stage Wauchope had died without being  replaced. Dowdall was deprived of his Primacy, but was not formally deposed as Archbishop.[4]With Mary's accession in 1553, and the re-establishment of Roman Catholicism in Ireland, Dowall was reappointed to the see of Armagh, this time with the Pope's approval, and he held the position until his death, some three months before Mary's. He was energetic in attempting to undo the effects of the Reformation, holding two provincial synods at Drogheda to restore the constitution of the pre-Reformation Church. He was particularly zealous in depriving married clergy of their livings, but was accused of taking  the opportunity to  persecute his  personal enemies,  such as George Browne, Archbishop of Dublin.[5] He was made a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. He died in London while on official business there.[6]",Romania,Armagh,1553.0,George Dowdall,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/darma.html,1558.0

"Richard Creagh (born at Limerick early in the sixteenth century; died in the Tower of London about December 1586) was an Irish Roman Catholic clergyman who was the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland in the second half of the sixteenth century.[1]The son of a merchant, his family (see Creagh) were Gaelic-Irish but had lived in Limerick town for some generations. He followed the same calling in his youth and made many voyages to Spain. A providential escape from shipwreck led him to embrace a religious life, and after some years of study abroad he was ordained priest. Returning to Ireland, he taught school for a time at Limerick.He refused nominations for the See of Limerick and See of Cashel, but the Papal nuncio, David Wolfe, determined to conquer his humility, named him for the primacy when it became vacant, and would accept no refusal. Creagh was consecrated at Rome, and in 1564 returned to Ireland as Archbishop of Armagh.Shane O'Neill was then the most potent of the Ulster chiefs. From the first he and Creagh disagreed. O'Neill hated England; Creagh preached loyalty to England in Armagh Cathedral, even in O'Neill's presence.

"Peter Lombard was born in Lumellogno[7] (then a rural commune, now a quartiere of Novara, Piedmont), in northwestern Italy, to a poor family.[8]  His date of birth was likely between 1095 and 1100.His education most likely began in Italy at the cathedral schools of Novara and Lucca.  The patronage of Odo, bishop of Lucca, who recommended him to Bernard of Clairvaux, allowed him to leave Italy and further his studies at Reims and Paris. Petrus Lombardus studied first in the cathedral school at Reims, where Magister Alberich and Lutolph of Novara were teaching, and arrived in Paris about 1134,[9] where Bernard recommended him[10] to the canons of the church of St. Victor.In Paris, where he spent the next decade teaching at the cathedral school of Notre Dame, he came into contact with Peter Abelard and Hugh of St. Victor, who were among the leading theologians of the time.  There are no proven facts relating to his whereabouts in Paris until 1142 when he became recognized as writer and teacher. Around 1145, Peter became a ""magister"", or professor, at the cathedral school of Notre Dame in Paris. Peter's means of earning a living before he began to derive income as a teacher and from his canon's prebend is shrouded in uncertainty.Lombard's style of teaching gained quick acknowledgment. It can be surmised that this attention is what prompted the canons of Notre Dame to ask him to join their ranks. He was considered a celebrated theologian by 1144. The Parisian school of canons had not included among their number a theologian of high regard for some years. The canons of Notre Dame, to a man, were members of the Capetian dynasty, relatives of families closely aligned to the Capetians by blood or marriage, scions of the Île-de-France or eastern Loire Valley nobility, or relatives of royal officials. In contrast, Peter had no relatives, ecclesiastical connections, and no political patrons in France. It seems that he must have been invited by the canons of Notre Dame solely for his academic merit.",Romania,Armagh,1601.0,Peter Lombard,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/darma.html,1625.0

For the rest  of his life he showed great concern for the welfare of the Priory.Wellesley  was called a man who ""had a singular mind towards the maintenance of English rule in Ireland"", and as a result he enjoyed the trust of Henry VIII. Henry proposed him as Bishop of Limerick, but the choice was rejected by the Pope. In 1520 Surrey,  the Lord Deputy of Ireland suggested him as Bishop of Cork, but Wellesley himself rejected the proposal when told that if he accepted the see of Cork  he could not remain Prior of Great Connell. Finally in 1529 he became Bishop of Kildare, on condition he could also remain Prior. He was Master of the Rolls in  1521-2.[3]Though he was trusted by the Crown to carry out its policies faithfully, Wellesley showed little enthusiasm for the Reformation. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries, his great concern was to ensure the survival of Great Connell. In 1537 he asked for it to be exempted  from confiscation on the ground that it was part of the Diocese of Kildare. His assurance to Thomas Cromwell that ""no brother is elected unless he be of the English nation"" was  not necessarily a sign of anti-Irish prejudice, since monasteries within the Pale were not permitted to admit Irish monks, and he may simply have been stressing that Great Connell observed this rule strictly.",Romania,Kildare and Leighlin,1529.0,Walter Wellesley,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dkild.html,1539.0

"Roche MacGeoghegan (1580 – 26 May 1644), also known as Roque de la Cruz, was a seventeenth-century Irish Dominican prelate and Tridentine reformist. A member of an aristocratic family from County Westmeath, he obtained a mostly Roman Catholic childhood education before, in his twenties, moving to Iberia and entering the Dominican Order. After many years promoting the revitalisation of the Order in Ireland, from Ireland and Continental Europe, he was considered unsuccessfully for the archbishopric of Armagh in 1625 and then successfully for the bishopric of Kildare in 1629, gaining himself the title of Ross, al Roche, D.D., Bishop of Kildare.[1] After a dozen years as bishop, his health slowly declined and he died in 1644. His nephew was historian and translator Conall MacGeoghegan.Born in 1580, Roche was the sixth son of Giles (Giles) ""Sheila"" O'Dempsey (1561-1619) and Ross MacGeoghegan (1549-1580), chief of the MacGeoghegan kindred of Moycashel, County Westmeath.[2] His family had a background of involvement in the Irish Counter-Reformation.[2] Later, two of his cousins became Dominican friars, and another cousin, Anthony MacGeoghegan, became the Roman Catholic Bishop of Clonmacnoise.[3]Despite being educated in a Protestant school for 6 months, the bulk of MacGeoghegan's early education was in the hands of Catholics, men such as the Westmeath priest John Power, as well as Catholic laymen in Westmeath and County Tipperary.[2] He travelled to Lisbon in 1600 and joined the Dominican Order, acquiring the name Roque de la Cruz.[2] At the Irish College in Lisbon he spent many months learning the Humanities, before he moved to Salamanca in 1601 .[2]MacGeoghegan spent 8 years at Salamanca, during many of which he lectured to students from Ireland.[2] From 1614 onwards he was active in Ireland in the service of his Order, promoting and reorganising the Dominicans on the island, who had declined almost to oblivion in the previous century.[2] He served as Vicar of the Dominican Order in Ireland between 1614 and 1617.[2] The revitalisation of the Order played an important part in the Irish counter-Reformation, and MacGeoghegan's leadership in this task required grants from the Pope to read banned texts, to grant marriage dispensation and to celebrate the sacraments anywhere on the island.[2]",Romania,Kildare and Leighlin,1629.0,Roche MacGeoghegan,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dkild.html,1641.0

"Hogan was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, on November 27, 1917. While he attended the University of Arkansas, he sang in local venues and modeled for department stores.[1]He entered the film industry at the age of 19, his first role in the small part of one of the young men in a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp in the 1937 drama Blazing Barriers.[2] His next film had him in the featured role of Bob D. Wilson in Annapolis Salute, directed by Christy Cabanne.[3] After small roles in Saturday's Heroes (1937),[4] and The Storm (1938),[5] he was again seen in a principal role in the 1938 John Ford comedy-drama, Submarine Patrol.[6] In 1939 he appeared in Charlie Chan in Reno (1939).[7]The early 1940s had Hogan appearing in lead and featured roles in numerous films. In 1940, he was featured in The Marines Fly High (1940), starring Richard Dix and Lucille Ball, as one of Dix's company of marines.[8] He then appeared in Rancho Grande, in which he played a spoiled rich heir unhappy at having to live on his grandfather's ranch.[9][10] He also had a featured role later that year in One Crowded Night, starring Billie Seward and William Haade.[11] Hogan had a starring role in the 1940 western, Prairie Law, which also starred George O'Brien and Virginia Vale.[12] Hogan also had a featured role that year in the drama One Crowded Night.[13]Hogan began 1941 as a bellhop in Play Girl, a romantic comedy starring Kay Francis,[14] and then appeared in a featured role in Pot o' Gold, a musical comedy starring James Stewart and Paulette Goddard. The film was remarkable, as it was the only film produced by James Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin D. Roosevelt.[15] In 1942 he appeared in several films in smaller roles, until late in the year when he had the featured role of Gibby Dapper in the Lew Landers' biopic, Smith of Minnesota (1942), about and starring the Heisman Trophy winner Bruce Smith,[16] after which Mug Town was released, in which Hogan starred along with the Dead End Kids.[17] Mug Town was followed quickly with a leading role in the 1943 comedy-drama, Cinderella Swings It, the final film in the ""Scattergood Baines"" film series.[18][19]",Romania,Clonmacnoise,1539.0,Richard Hogan,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dc554.html,1539.0

"Born in St. George's Rectory, Montreal, he was the oldest son of Edward Sullivan and Frances Mary Renaud. In 1869, his father became rector of Trinity Church, Chicago. The family lived to the city in 1871, and thus witnessed the Great Chicago Fire. When he was 15, he began attending Loretto in Musselburgh, Scotland, a famous school for boys.On his return to Canada, he attended the School of Practical Science, Toronto. After this he did railway exploration work in the West, and later worked in mining. He was assistant engineer in the Clergue enterprises at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario for a year and a half, before the organization of the Consolidated Lake Superior Company. Subsequently, he spent several years as a mining engineer in the Lake of the Woods district during the period of its gold exploitation.He gained recognition in the United States through his poems, short stories and comprehensive articles on various themes. These frequently appeared in Harper's Magazine, the Atlantic Monthly, and other leading American periodicals. In 1941 he won the Governor General's Award for English language fiction for the novel Three Came to Ville Marie.

"Luke Wadding, O.F.M. (16 October 1588 – 18 November 1657), was an Irish Franciscan friar and historian.Wadding was born on 16 October 1588 in Waterford to Walter Wadding of Waterford, a wealthy merchant,[1] and his wife, Anastasia Lombard (sister of Peter Lombard, Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of Ireland).[1] Educated at the school of Mrs. Jane Barden in Waterford and of Peter White in Kilkenny, in 1604 he went to study in Lisbon and at the University of Coimbra.[2]After completing his university studies, Wadding became a Franciscan friar in 1607, and spent his novitiate at Matosinhos, Portugal. He was ordained priest in 1613 by João Manuel, Bishop of Viseu, and in 1617 he was made President of the Irish College at the University of Salamanca, and Master of Students and Professor of Divinity.[1] The next year, he went to Rome as chaplain to the Spanish ambassador to the Papal States, Bishop Antonio Trejo de Sande, O.F.M. Wadding collected the funds for the establishment of the College of St. Isidore in Rome, for the education of Irish priests, opened 24 June 1625, with four lecturers — Anthony O'Hicidh of a famous literary family in Thomond, Martin Breathnach from Donegal, Patrick Fleming from Louth, and John Punch from Cork. He gave the college a library of 5,000 printed books and 800 manuscripts, and thirty resident students soon came. Wadding served as rector of the college for 15 years. From 1630 to 1634, he was Procurator of the Order of Friars Minor at their headquarters in Rome, and Vice Commissary from 1645 to 1648.  During the papal conclaves of 1644 and 1655, Wadding received votes to become pope, making him ""as close as the church has come to having an Irish pope.""[3]Wadding was an enthusiastic supporter of the Irish Catholics during the Irish Confederate Wars, and his college became the strongest advocate of the Irish cause in Rome. (This spirit of patriotism originated by Wadding had a lasting impact, so that the 19th-century Catholic Archbishop George Errington, who was sent by Gladstone[who?] to explain the relation of English and Irish politics in Rome, reported that those Irish politicians thought most extreme in England were conservatives compared with the collegians of St. Isidore.)[citation needed] Wadding sent officers and arms to Ireland, and induced Pope Innocent X to send there Giovanni Battista Rinuccini.[citation needed]",Romania,Ferns,1678.0,Luke Wadding,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dfern.html,1691.0

"Sergeant Nicholas ""Sam"" Foran (June 3, 1844 – September 29, 1927) was an American soldier in the U.S. Army who served with the 8th U.S. Cavalry during the Apache Wars. He was one of thirty-four men who received the Medal of Honor for gallantry in several engagements against the Apache Indians in the Arizona Territory from August to October 1868.Nicholas Foran was born in County Waterford, Ireland on June 3, 1844. He later emigrated to the United States and enlisted in the U.S. Army in St. Louis, Missouri in 1867. Assigned to frontier duty with the 8th U.S. Cavalry, Foran participated in the Apache Wars in the late-1860s. In the late summer and fall of 1868, Foran was part of a small cavalry detachment ordered to secure settlements and protect the Arizona Territory from Apache raiding parties. From August to October, a group of 50-60 cavalry troopers from Companies B and L frequently fought the Apache  during their patrols. Cavalrymen such as Foran experienced ambushes and sniper attacks from hidden ravines. After the campaign's end, he and thirty-four other men received the Medal of Honor for ""bravery in scouts and actions against Indians"". The award presentation, held on July 24, 1869, was one of the largest held at the time.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]Foran was later posted to Fort Whipple in Prescott, Arizona. In 1872, he was finally discharged from Fort Union, New Mexico at the rank of sergeant. Returning to Arizona, he worked the mines in the McCabe district for 35 years before permanently settling in Prescott. His home at 144 North Granite Street, which no longer exists, was opened to the poor and said to be a ""haven for all"". Foran died in Prescott on September 29, 1927, at the age of 83. He was interred at the Prescott National Cemetery.[5][9] His a biography of his life, in which he was praised as a ""typical trail blazer and a Western pioneer"", was published in the Evening Courier three days after his death.[10]On May 27, 1984, a new headstone officially recognizing Foran as an MOH recipient was placed at his gravesite. Although a special government project had started marking gravesites in 1976, it would take nearly 8 years before Foran was confirmed as an award recipient in the fall of 1983 by the Medal of Honor Historical Society in Alexandria, Virginia.[10][11]",Romania,Galway and Kilmacduagh,,Nicholas Foran,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dgalw.html,

"David Rothe was born in 1573 in High Street Kilkenny. His maternal grandmother, Ellen Butler, was first cousin to Pierce the Red, Eighth Earl of Ormond.[1] He studied at the Irish College, Douai, and at the University of Salamanca, where he graduated doctor in civil and canon law. He was ordained in 1600, and proceeded to Rome. From 1601 to 1609 he was professor of theology and secretary to Peter Lombard (Archbishop of Armagh), and on 15 June 1609, was appointed Vice-Primate of Armagh.[2]Having been made prothonotary Apostolic, Rothe arrived in Ireland in 1610. He resided part of the time in Kilkenny City, and part of the time in Balleen, with his cousin Richard Butler, 3rd Viscount Mountgarret. One of his first tasks was to resolve disputes between secular(parish) and religious(such as the Cistercians) clergy over faculties and jurisdiction.[3] Rothe held a synod for the Ulster Province at Drogheda, in February, 1614, and a second synod in 1618. Rothe was under close government surveillance, and the fact that he was not either imprisoned or banished was probably due to Lord Mountgarret and other powerful friends.[3]Rothe was appointed Bishop of Ossory on 10 October 1618. At that the time the archbishops of Ireland, (Armagh, Tuam, Cashel, and Dublin) were all in exile on the Continent. Owing to the severity of the penal laws, he had to seek consecration in Paris, where he was ordained bishop 1 April 1619. He returned to Ireland in late 1621,[1] after publishing two ecclesial works. Rothe became the most prominent bishop in Ireland.[4]In 1624, Rothe presided over a synod at Kilkenny, and he laboured zealously during a trying period. Rothe’s prominence in the country and the relatively peaceful state of Kilkenny led to the Confederate ‘parliament’ meeting in the city in the 1642, and welcomed the papal nuncio, Rinuccini, to Kilkenny, on 14 November 1645. Three years later, he refused to acknowledge the validity of the censures issued by Rinuccini. David Rothe, like other bishops appointed during Lombard's tenure, tended to be more moderate toward state authority.[5] Although seriously ill in 1649, he continued to minister to the plague-stricken citizens of Kilkenny but was compelled by the Cromwellians to leave on 28 March 1650. After being robbed along the way, he was permitted to return to his brother's house, where he died 20 April 1650.[6] His remains were interred in St. Mary's Church, but there is a cenotaph to his memory in St. Canice's Cathedral.",Romania,Ossory,1618.0,David Rothe,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dosso.html,1650.0

"Myles Francis Martin Murphy (14 February 1927 – 16 November 2016) was an English painter known for his mathematical approach to depictions of the human figure which he learned at the Slade School of Art where he later taught. In 1954 he was seriously burned while painting himself in a wedding dress but subsequently won the Slade diploma prize for the portrait he was working on at the time. In 1974, he won the John Moores Painting Prize for Figure with Yellow Foreground.Myles Murphy was born on 14 February 1927 in Bury, Lancashire, into a Catholic family of eight children. His parents intended him to train as a doctor but instead he was influenced into art by L. S. Lowry who was teaching evening classes in Bury.[1] He entered the Slade School of Art[2] where he stayed for four years until 1955 and was taught by William Coldstream and Claude Rogers. He joined a group of students to whom Coldstream taught a precise method of depicting the human form using mathematical measuring that Murphy used for the rest of his life.[1]In 1954, at his flat in Lower Marsh, in London's South Bank, Murphy planned to paint his then-girlfriend in a wedding dress. When she failed to arrive to model it, he decided to prepare a self-portrait in front of a mirror, wearing the dress himself. While doing so, the dress caught fire when it touched a paraffin heater and Murphy fell backwards on to a sofa that had been covered by his flatmate with petrol in order to kill bedbugs. In attempting to extinguish the flames, Murphy threw burning furniture out of the flat window onto the street market below. He was badly burned but recovered sufficiently to win the Slade diploma prize for the painting he was working on at the time.[1]In 1955, he and Craigie Aitchison, a fellow student and close friend, won an Abbey Travelling Scholarship[3] and drove to Ravenna in Italy in a dilapidated old London taxi that Aitchison bought for £45.[1] The taxi finally broke down outside Rome central station where the two students were assisted by a cleric from the Vatican who stored the vehicle in the Vatican's basement.[4]",Romania,Ossory,,Myles Murphy,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dosso.html,

"Tanner's early life is unknown; he left Ireland by 1559, and reached Italy via Spain. In 1565 he was a Catholic priest in Rome, and entered the Society of Jesus.[1] After a year at the Roman College he was sent to Dillingen University in 1567, and became doctor of divinity. His health, however, failed and he left the Society. In 1574 he was again at Rome, and the See of Cork and Cloyne being vacant, he was appointed to it, 5 November 1574, and was consecrated at Rome.[2]In May, 1575, Tanner set out for Ireland with exceptional faculties for his own diocese and for those of Cashel, Dublin, and its suffragan sees in the absence of their respective prelates. Not long after his reaching Ireland he was captured while exercising his functions at Clonmel, and was thrown into prison; here, as Holing tells, he was visited by a Protestant bishop whom he reconciled to the Church. A few days later he was himself released through the influence of a noble earl.[2]Thereafter he did not venture into his own diocese but as Commissary Apostolic he traversed the other districts assigned him, administering the sacraments and discharging in secret the other duties of his office. After four years he died in the Diocese of Ossory, 4 June 1579. Anthony Bruodin states that he died in Dublin Castle after eighteen months of imprisonment and torture.[2] On the other hand, Fennessy in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography writes that he died at Cullahill, where his host was Barnaby Fitzpatrick.[1]This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

"Since the separation of the English church from Rome by Henry VIII and Elizabeth I was the Catholicism in the British dominion prohibited as anti-royal and treasonable and was prosecuted in part bloody. In Ireland, the majority of the hierarchy and the population resisted Protestantism.Derot McGrath was a grandnephew of Richard Creagh, the Catholic Archbishop of Armagh († 1588 in the Tower of London), and a cousin of Miler Magrath († 1622). This, originally Franciscan minority and from 1565 Catholic bishop of Down and Connor, played a double role in the royal church policy, 1571 Anglican Archbishop of Cashel, but at the same time protected his ""papist"" cousin by specific information. [2] Dermot McGrath studied Abroad theology, returned to Ireland at the time of the second Desmond Rebellion [1] and was appointed on 12 October 1580 by the Pope against the decidedly Protestant Bishop Matthew Sheyne († 1582, successor William Lyon) Catholic Bishop of Cork and Cloyne , His counter-Reformation zeal led to the rapid recatholicization of Cork, so that in 1603 leading citizens burned Protestant Bibles and books of worship and tried to restore the Catholic Mass in the churches of the city. He used this to the dissatisfaction of the population caused by the Munster Plantation. McGrath escaped the arrest and execution on several occasions, as in November 1600, when soldiers of the Earl of Thomond [1] tracked him down in a hiding place in the country, but because of his Teared clothes and poorness did not recognize. After that, his track loses. In 1614, the Holy See appointed an Apostolic Vicar for Cork and Cloyne; Consequently, McGrath had died at this time.",Romania,Cork and Ross,1580.0,Dermot McGrath,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dcork.html,1603.0

"The Most Rev. Dr Miler Magrath or Miler McGrath (also Myler; in Irish, Maolmhuire Mag Raith: servant of Mary, son of grace) (c. 1523 – 14 November 1622), was an Irish priest and archbishop born in County Fermanagh, Ireland. He came from a family of hereditary historians of the O'Brien clan. He entered the Franciscan Order and was ordained to the Roman Catholic priesthood. The Vatican later appointed him the Bishop of Down and Connor in Ireland, but he converted to the Anglican Church of England (since the passage of the 'Irish Church Act 1869' the Anglican Church in Ireland is known as the 'Church of Ireland') and became the Protestant Archbishop of Cashel. He is viewed with contempt by both Protestant and Catholic historians, owing to his ambiguous and corrupt activities during the Reformation. He also served as a member of the Parliament of Ireland.Magrath was possibly born at or near Termon Magrath Castle just outside the village of Pettigo in what is now the south-east of County Donegal in Ulster. During Magrath's lifetime, Termon Magrath Castle and its surrounding area was part of Fermanagh. Magrath became a Franciscan priest and spent his early life in Rome – ""on the Capitoline"" – whence he was sent on a mission to Ireland. It was believed that, on passing through England, he displayed his Catholic letters of authorisation to demand bribes for accepting the Reformation. In any case, he appears to have satisfied the authorities that his position as a Catholic bishop in Ireland would not preclude his valid assent to the Act of Supremacy.In October 1565, Magrath was appointed as the Roman Catholic Bishop of Down and Connor, although the temporalities were ruled over by his kinsman Shane O'Neill, chief of the O'Neill clan, whom he visited in 1566. In May 1567 he attended on the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Henry Sidney, at Drogheda, where he agreed to conform to the reformed faith and to hold his See of the Crown. However, in 1569 John Merriman was appointed the Protestant Bishop of Down and Connor, and Magrath held on to the Catholic See, before he was finally deprived of Down and Connor by Rome in 1580 for heresy and other matters; thus he had enjoyed dual appointments as Roman Catholic and Church of Ireland prelate for nine years.In 1570, Magrath was appointed by the Crown as the Protestant Bishop of Clogher, including the temporalities, and visited England, where he fell ill of a fever. In February 1571, he was then appointed Archbishop of Cashel and Bishop of Emly (no new appointment was made to Clogher until 1605). In the same year he imprisoned some Franciscan priests at Cashel. In a rage, the rebel crusader James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald threatened to burn to ashes everyone and everything connected with Archbishop Magrath if they were not released. The friars were immediately liberated by Edward Butler. In 1572 he brought charges against Butler's elder brother, The 10th Earl of Ormonde, but they were given no credence. In 1575, as he went on his way to Dublin, he was attacked and badly injured by the kerne of a hostile clan.",Romania,Down and Connor,1565.0,Miler Magrath,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/ddown.html,1580.0

"William Brooke Joyce (24 April 1906 – 3 January 1946), nicknamed Lord Haw-Haw, was an American-born, Anglo-Irish Fascist politician and Nazi propaganda broadcaster to the United Kingdom during World War II. He took German citizenship in 1940. He was convicted of one count of high treason in 1945 and sentenced to death. The Court of Appeal and the House of Lords upheld his conviction. He was hanged on 3 January 1946, making him the last person to be executed for treason in the United Kingdom. (Theodore Schurch was hanged the following day, but for the crime of treachery rather than treason.)William Brooke Joyce was born on Herkimer Street in Brooklyn, New York,[2] United States. His father was Michael Francis Joyce (9 December 1866 – 19 February 1941) an Irish Catholic from a family of farmers in Ballinrobe, County Mayo, who had taken United States citizenship on 25 October 1894. His mother was Gertrude Emily Brooke, who although born in Shaw and Crompton, Lancashire, England, was from a well-off Anglican Anglo-Irish family of medical practitioners associated with County Roscommon.A few years after William's birth, the family returned to Salthill, Galway, permanently. Joyce attended Coláiste Iognáid, a Jesuit school in Galway (from 1915–21). Joyce's mother was strongly Anglocentric and despite tensions with her father for marrying a Roman Catholic, remained staunchly Protestant and Unionist herself, hostile to Irish nationalism. Joyce's father bought up houses and rented some to the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC).It was during the Irish War for Independence that Joyce was recruited by Capt. Patrick William Keating as a courier for British Army intelligence in Galway, then fighting against the Irish Republican Army.[3][4] He was known to have hung around with Black and Tans at Lenaboy Castle, which reportedly resulted in the Irish Republican Army dispatching a volunteer, Michael Molloy, to murder Joyce on his way home from school in December 1921, although minors were normally excluded from being executed by the IRA, usually being expelled or ostracised. Joyce reputedly survived only because his father had moved his family to another house on a different route. Capt. Keating arranged for William Joyce to be mustered into the Worcester Regiment soon after, taking him out of the dangerous situation in Ireland to Norton Barracks. A few months later he was discharged when it was found out he was underage.[5]",Romania,Tuam,1485.0,William John Joyce,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dtuam.html,1501.0

"Flaithrí Ó Maolchonaire was born in the townland of Figh, civil parish of Tibohine, barony of Frenchpark, County Roscommon.[1] His father and mother were Fíthil and Onóra Ó Maolchonaire. Two other sons survived to adulthood, Maoilechlainn and Firbisigh. They belonged to a well-known family of historians and poets whose principal estate was at Cluain Plocáin (Ballymulconry), civil parish of Kiltrustan, County Roscommon. Flaithrí was brought up in the family profession.He studied for the priesthood at Salamanca, entering the Irish college founded in 1592. Ó Maolchonaire first studied the liberal arts and philosophy. On 10 December 1594, he was in the third year of his studies at Salamanca. A year earlier he had translated into Irish a short Castilian catechism by Jerónimo de Ripalda SJ. The original is a simple catechetical work written in Aristotelian master-pupil dialogue. According to Mícheál Mac Craith, Ó Maolchonaire's translation pointedly referred to the Irish as Eirinnach rather than Gaedheal.[2]After five years at the Salamanca Irish college, Ó Maolchonaire left to join the Franciscan province of Santiago. Aodh Mac Cathmhaoil was among his classmates in the Salamanca Franciscan friary. They and nine of their peers in the Santiago province were later raised to the episcopacy, an unprecedented development in the history of the order. In a memorial of 1606, Francisco Arias Dávila y Bobadilla, conde de Puñonrostro, stated that Ó Maolchonaire was ordained after taking the habit of the friars minor.[3]At the height of the Nine Years' War, Flaithrí Ó Maolchonaire sailed to Ireland where he served as a confessor and preacher to troops under the command of Hugh O'Neill and Red Hugh O'Donnell. In 1601, they requested a bishopric for Ó Maolchonaire 'in recognition of his diligence, commending his sound judgment on Irish affairs.'[4] After the disaster of Kinsale in 1601, Ó Maolchonaire accompanied O'Donnell to Spain as his confessor and adviser, hoping to see a renewal of Spanish military intervention in Ireland.",Romania,Tuam,1609.0,Florence Conry,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dtuam.html,1629.0

"Adam served as the Papal missionary in Persia from 1314 to 1317, one of six Dominicans sent by Pope John XXII to Persia. However, it is now thought that Adam was probably in Persia before 1314, during the pontificate of Pope Clement V.He was transferred to Smyrna in 1318, and served as their bishop. In 1322, he was promoted archbishop of Soltaniyeh in Persia.[1]On 26 October 1324, he was elected Archbishop of Antivari in the Old Doclea. He after a disagreement with the Pope, Adam stepped down as archbishop in 1341. Also he wrote about the Scestani  and kathars history about this area.A 1332 document written in Latin that may have been authored by Guillaume Adam (although it may also have been the work of Brocardus Monacus (Frère Brochard)) testifies the existence of written Albanian at that time, although no records of written Albanian have been retrieved from before the 15th century. Though the reference to the existence of the language is clear, that to writing in Albanian is ambiguous. It cannot be said for certain whether the author meant Albanian-language books written in Latin script or simply books written in Latin.[2]",Montenegro,Bar (Antivari),1324.0,Guillaume Adam,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dbary.html,1341.0

"Since he usually identified himself as ""Frater Georgius"", he is known in Hungarian history as ""Fráter György"".Most details of Martinuzzi's life before 1528 are uncertain.[8] He was the youngest son of a Croatian lesser nobleman, Grgur Utješinović, and Anna Martinuzzi, who was descended from a Venetian patrician family.[9][10] He was born in Kamičac Castle, near Skradin, on 18 June 1482.[9][10] He was still a child when his father and his two oldest brothers died and the Ottomans occupied the family estates.[11] Duke John Corvinus took care of the orphan in 1490.[12] Martinuzzi was sent to Corvin's castle at Hunyad (now Hunedoara in Romania).[12] He lived in wretched conditions for years, because young noblemen were intentionally treated like servants for pedagogical purposes.[13]Martinuzzi moved to the court of Hedwig of Cieszyn in Szepes Castle (now Spiš Castle in Slovakia) around 1503.[14] She was the widow of his father's patron, Count Stephen Zápolya.[14] Initially, he served as a page, then he was made a guard of the palace.[9][15] He decided to abandon his military career and entered the Pauline Order at the age of 24.[16] He most probably settled in the Budaszentlőrinc Monastery where he learnt to read and write.[16] He was sent to continue his studies in the Jasna Góra Monastery in Częstochowa.[16] He was made the head of the monastery, according to unproved theories.[16] After he returned to Hungary in 1527, he became the prior of the Sajólád Monastery, which had recently received grants from the Zápolyas.[17]Martinuzzi's sister, Ana, married Bartol Drašković and had three sons (one of whom was Croatian Ban (viceroy) and cardinal Juraj Drašković).",Ireland,"Oradea Mare {Gran Varadino, Nagyvárad}",1539.0,Györgi Martinuzzi,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dorad.html,1551.0

"Not much is known of his early life, although he is known to have been married twice.  He is believed to have been an educated man, and a Lutheran.He is mainly known for his role as an explosives expert in the Siege of Eger (1552).After the siege, he was given command of the Castle of Eger.

"Gifted with a precocious intellect, Agricola early threw himself into the pursuit of the ""new learning"", with such effect that at the age of 24, he was appointed Rector extraordinarius of Greek at the so-called Great School of Zwickau, and made his appearance as a writer on philology. After four years, he gave up his appointment to pursue his studies at Leipzig, where, as rector, he received the support of the professor of classics, Peter Mosellanus (1493–1525), a celebrated humanist of the time, with whom he had already been in correspondence. Here, he also devoted himself to the study of medicine, physics, and chemistry. He went to Italy from 1524 to 1526, where he took his doctor's degree.He returned to Zwickau in 1527, and was chosen as town physician at Joachimsthal, a centre of mining and smelting works, his object being partly ""to fill in the gaps in the art of healing"", and partly to test what had been written about mineralogy by careful observation of ores and the methods of their treatment. His thorough grounding in philology and philosophy had accustomed him to systematic thinking, and this enabled him to construct out of his studies and observations of minerals a logical system which he began to publish in 1528. Agricola's dialogue Bermannus, sive de re metallica dialogus [Bermannus; or a dialogue on metallurgy], (1530) the first attempt to reduce to scientific order the knowledge won by practical work, brought Agricola into notice; it contained an approving letter from Erasmus at the beginning of the book.In 1530, Prince Maurice of Saxony appointed him historiographer with an annual allowance, and he migrated to Chemnitz, the centre of the mining industry, to widen the range of his observations. The citizens showed their appreciation of his learning by appointing him town physician in 1533. In that year, he published a book about Greek and Roman weights and measures, De Mensuris et Ponderibus.He was also elected burgomaster of Chemnitz. His popularity was, however, short-lived. Chemnitz was a violent centre of the Protestant movement, while Agricola never wavered in his allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church; he was forced to resign his office. He now lived apart from the contentious movements of the time, devoting himself wholly to learning. His chief interest was still in mineralogy, but he occupied himself also with medical, mathematical, theological and historical subjects, his chief historical work being the Dominatores Saxonici a prima origine ad hanc aetatem, published at Freiberg. In 1544, he published the De ortu et causis subterraneorum, in which he laid the first foundations of a physical geology, and criticized the theories of the ancients.  However, he maintained that a certain 'materia pinguis' or 'fatty matter,' set into fermentation by heat, gave birth to fossil organic shapes, as opposed to fossil shells having belonged to living animals.[3] In 1545, he followed with the De natura eorum quae effluunt e terra; in 1546 the De veteribus et novis metallis, a comprehensive account of the discovery and occurrence of minerals and also more commonly known as De Natura Fossilium; in 1548, the De animantibus subterraneis; and in the two following years a number of smaller works on the metals.",Slovakia,Maribor,1570.0,Georg Agricola,http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dmask.html,1584.0

"Rinaldo Scarlicchio was born in Graz. His family was originally from Montefiascone in Lazio. He joined the Franciscan Order and was in 1622 by Pope Gregory XV. appointed Bishop of Trieste. On 14th August 1622 Tomasz Hren, Bishop of Ljubljana, was co-consecrated by Girolamo Rusca, Bishop of Capo d'Istria and Etienne Weinberger, Auxiliary Bishop of Breslau. According to legend, in 1624 Scarlicchio discovered the relics of St. Justus, patron saint the Cathedral of Trieste, which have been lost since the beginning of the 14th century.
